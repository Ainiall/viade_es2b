== Architecture Constraints

.Introduction
There are some constraints in the development of our application. These constraints are technical, organitazional and conventional. The following tables detail these constraints.

.Technical Constraints
|===
|Constraint
|Explanation

|Decentralized architecture
|The project architecture will be descentralized, which means user data is separated from the application and users are the one who control the flow of information.In order to achieve that,we will use SOLID specifications.

|React
|The project interface will be develop with React. This library will desing and update effectively the proper components when the data changed. It's mandatory to have some knowdledge at HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript for using React.

|JavaScript
|JavaScript will be used to develop this project as it is the base language of React.

|Node.js
|Node is used for making server side applicattions with Javascript. We'll be using it to generate our app.

|Travis
|Travis is a continuous integration platform that automatically tests and builds code changes on every push.

|Codevoc
|Codecov provides highly integrated tools to group, merge, archive, and compare coverage reports. 

|Codacy
|Codacy automatically identifies issues through static code review analysis. It's used for detecting duplicate code, security issues, code coverage and code complexity in every commit and pull request.

|Compatibility and adaptability
|This project can be used at any major web browser (Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari...) and Operating Systems in order to fullfill maximum market coverage.

|SOLID PODs (data storage)
|For the storage and management of the user data we will use the SOLID PODs, as it is required by the assignment and the SOLID specification.There won't be any database in this project.

.Organitazional and political constraints
|===
|Constraint
|Explanation

|Git
|Git is a control version system.
It will allow us to lead a colaborative development and simplify the sharing and reviewing of it.

|GitHub
|Our project will be managed using GitHub, a configuration management system that will facilitate us working together.

|Continuous delivery
|The project will have several deliveries throughout its development to be review by teachers.

|Team
|This project will be developed by a random development group, with the difficulties of adaptation that this implies.

|Project budget
|This project will be developed by students without a source of income available to improve its development.
For that reason only free development tools were used.

|Meetings
|We must keep track of every meeting at the poject's wiki to ensure everyone can follow up our workflow.

|License
|This is an Open Source project published under de MIT License.
	

All the contents included in the project should be Open Source published under the MIT license.

.Conventions

|Constraint
|Explanation

|arc42
|As a template for documentation, we must use arc42 in order to make it clean and useful for future readers.

|AsciiDoctor
|Our project will be using AsciiDoctor to convert AsciiDoc documentation into HTML5 content.

|Language
|This project needs to be internationalized in order to make it accesible to the Inrupt community.For that reason this project will be entirely developed in English
