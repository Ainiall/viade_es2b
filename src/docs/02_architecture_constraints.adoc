.Technical Constraints
|===
|Constraint
|Explanation

|Decentralized architecture
|The project architecture will be descentralized, which means user data is separated from the application and users are the one who control the flow of information.In order to achieve that,we will use SOLID specifications.

|React
|The project interface will be develop with React. This library will desing and update effectively the proper components when the data changed. It's mandatory to have some knowdledge at HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript for using React.

|JavaScript
|JavaScript will be used to develop this project as it is the base language of React.

|SOLID PODs
|For the storage and management of the user data we will use the SOLID PODs, as it is required by the assignment and the SOLID specification.

|Continuous delivery
|The project will have several deliveries throughout its development to be review by teachers.

|Team
|This project will be developed by a random development group, with the difficulties of adaptation that this implies.

For that reason only free development tools were used.
