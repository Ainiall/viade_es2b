== Introduction and Goals

****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. These include

* underlying business goals, essential features and functional requirements for the system
* quality goals for the architecture
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****

=== Requirements Overview

****

* System will use a descentralized architecture, being the data independent from the system.

* System will let users to share info to other users, using a friendly-style. In addition, users can have a group of that "friends" for share instantly routes with them. 

* Registred users can store their map routes in their own devices.

* Same way, registred users can see all routes on the entire available map.

* System will recognize routed stored by other programs.

|Priority|Objective|Detail
| 1 | Usability | System will be intuitive for all kind of users, needing a short time for them to get acquainted with it.
| 2 | Performance | The system must be effective and fast, with short loading times for the users.
| 3 | Security | System will be secure. Private data will only be shown if the user how owns it decides to share it.
| 4 | Testability | Tests must be carried out to verify the correct operation of the system.

|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
| Basic users | New users to use the app. The app should be build in a way that they understand how the app works and their data is stored. | They will expect the app to be simple and intuitive. There are explanations about PODs for those users how don't know how it works.
| Experienced users | Users who know about PODs and their usage. | They will expect the app to be simple and efficient. The POD management should be similar to other SOLID apps' usage.
| Developers | These are the people in charge of the develop of the app, so they should understand all the components of the app and the technologies used. | They are expected to develop a secure, simple and usable application.
| SOLID Developers | They are in charge of defining the SOLID standards. Therefore, they will have a great impact in the design and way of work of the application. | They will mark some constrains to the project but they will also help with the documenatation and guidelines of the SOLID standard. They will also provied the SOLID code.
