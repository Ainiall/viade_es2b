|Risks and Technical Debts
|Measures to minimize risks


| *Solid* is a totally *new* concept to us, so it might take us _some time_ to get used to it. 
| List of useful SOLID resources attached to the project for quick usage.

| *JavaScript* is _not our main_ programming field. Eventhough we used it in the past, it's still hard to us to adapt to it as we only know the basics.
| Another list as the one mentioned above.

|* *React* is the JS UI (User Interface) library chosen to develop this app. It's the _first time_ we are using this library and it can lead to having some mistakes.
| Implement Bootstrap to ease this aspect, and investigate about other available libraries that might help the developing process.

| *Libraries* might be used during the development of the app. As we do not own the code we might experience some trouble with the understanding of their use.
| Avoid using templates or libraries if we don't fully understand them.

| *Documentation* should be written in Engish to ease it's internationallity. As it's not our main language we take the risk to explain something wrongly or not as nicely as we intend.
| Verify the English text is properly written and it's a good representation of what we intend to tell.

| *Security* and *condifentiality* are a main concern at a decentralized app. Data should be encrypted in order to ensure these criteria and we are not experts at security just yet.
| As it's a complex task and we don't know much about it yet, we'll postpone it to a future version.

| *Lack of time* to complete the project, as we are pretty busy
| Keep a constant workflow.

| *Undocumented* project because of lack of time
| Do a basic singleline comment where necessary.

| Problems with *git*
| Use subbranches and only pull request to main once it's been all tested at develop.
