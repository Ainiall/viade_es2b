|Risks
|Measures to minimize risks

| *Solid* is a totally *new* concept to us, so it might take us _some time_ to get used to it. 
| List of useful SOLID resources attached to the project for quick usage.

| *JavaScript* is _not our main_ programming language. Eventhough we used it in the past, it's still hard to us to adapt to it as we only know the basics.
| Another list as the one mentioned above.

| *React* is the JS UI (User Interface) library established to develop this app. It's the _first time_ we are using this library and it can lead to having some mistakes.
| Implement Material UI to ease this aspect, and investigate about other available libraries that might help the developing process.

| *Libraries* might be used during the development of the app. As we do not own the code we might experience some trouble with the understanding of their use.
| Avoid using templates or libraries if we don't fully understand them.

| *Documentation* should be written in Engish to ease it's internationallity. As it's not our main language we take the risk to explain something wrongly or not as nicely as we intend.
| Verify the English text is properly written and it's a good representation of what we intend to tell.

| Problems with *git* workflow
| Use subbranches and only pull request to main once it's been all tested at develop.

|Possible future solution

| *Security* and *condifentiality* are a main concern at a decentralized app. Data should be encrypted in order to ensure these criteria and we are not experts at security just yet.
| As it's a complex task and we don't know much about it yet, we'll postpone it to a future version of the app.

| *Lack of time* to complete the project, as we are pretty busy.
| As this is an open source project, we can keep working on them once our assignment is done.

| *Undocumented* code because of lack of time.
| Do a basic singleline comment where necessary and explain main issues using GitHub issues and project documentation.

| *Code cleaning*
| Code might me refactored later on.

| *Performance*
| We improved our initial times but it could still be improved.

| *Interoperabillity*
| We should follow viadeSpec in order to load routes created by other teams.
