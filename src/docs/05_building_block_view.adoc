== Building Block View
This block shows the decomposition of the system into building blocks and their respective dependencies.

=== Whitebox Overall System

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Name|Responsibility
| User | Interacts with the application
| Viade | It's the application. Contains all the functionality about route displaying, friends, groups...
| POD | One for each user. Provides all the routes and other information like friends, etc...
| Leaflet | This is the API we use to show the routes in the map
|===

=== Level 2
The whitebox shown at this level is the application: Viade

Those clasified as blackboxes will be further explained in the Level 3 part.
Those clasified as components don't need further decomposition, as they are already small and don't have enough complexity.
We have shown the user, the POD and Leaflet as we consider them necessary to explain this level.

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Name|Responsibility
| Components | The parts of each container. They provide different functionalities like showing the routes or the access to our friends list
| Containers | They represent all the different views and pages that compose our application. They are what the user interacts with
| Route | This is used to store all the information related to the route: the route itself, the images, the name, the privacy...
| POD Manager | Interacts with the POD, receiving the files requested by the containers and sending them
|===

=== Level 3
At this level we have two whiteboxes: Components and Containers

==== Components

image::05_building_block_view_3.png[Building block view diagram]

Here we can see two important things:

* The map is the component that interacts directly with Leaflet (the API that provides the map).
* All the components of this whitebox are used by the components of container whitebox. The relation with the containers implies also that the components receive all the necessary 
information to work from them.

There are more components, but the ones shown here are the most relevant.

Contained Building Blocks::

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Name|Responsibility
| NavBar | The top bar of the application. We have two: one for the users not logged in and another for the ones that are currently logged in. 
It provides different functionalities like the view with the routes or the one with the list of friends
| Footer | The bottom part of every view. It displays our organization and the version of the application
| Spinner | This component displays all the images that a route has
| RouteList | It shows all the different routes that a user has in his POD
| FormEditRoute | From this form, we can edit our routes
| Map | Shows the selected route drawn in the world map
|===

==== Containers

The discontinuous arrow shows the navegation of our aplication; the movement between containers that the user can do.
The continuous ones show interaction between components; they imply a flow of information.

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Name|Responsibility
| Home | The default view. It is shown when the user is logged in. You can find things like the map or the images here
| Login | The default view when a user accesses the application without logging in. Here you can log yourself in or access to the register view
| Profile | It shows the user that is currently in the application
| Register | When accessed, it allows the user to register in a SOLID provider
| Friends | This view shows our SOLID friends and also the groups we are in. We can create or delete groups
