== Building Block View
This block shows the decomposition of the system into building blocks and their respective dependencies.

=== Whitebox Overall System

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Name|Responsibility
| User | Interacts with the application
| Viade | Allows to see all the information and processes related with the routes
| POD | One for each user. Provides all the routes and other information like friends, etc...
|===

=== Level 2
The whitebox shown at this level is the application: Viade

|Name|Responsibility
| Parser | Reveives the file of the route and "translates" it into the map
| Components | The parts of each container. They provide different functionalities like showing the routes or the access to our friends list
| Containers | They represent all the differente views and pages that compose our application. They are what the user interacts with
| POD Manager | Interacts with the POD, receiving the files requested by the containers and sending them
|===

=== Level 3
At this level we have two whiteboxes: Components and Containers

==== Components

| NavBar | The top bar of the application. We have two: one for the users not logged in and another for the ones that are currently logged in. 
It provides different functionalities like the view with the routes or the one with the list of friends
| Footer | The bottom part of every view. It displays our organization and the version of the application
| Spinner | This component displays all the images that a route has
| RouteList | It shows all the different routes that a user has in his POD
| FormEditRoute | From this form, we can edit our routes
| Notifications | Displays the different notifications of the app
| Map | Shows the selected route drawn in the world map

| Home | The default view. It is shown when the user is logged in. You can find things like the map or the images here
| Login | The default view when a user accesses the application without logging in. Here you can log yourself in or access to the register view
| PageNotFound | It is shown when a Container/view is not found
| Profile | It shows the user that is currently in the application
| Register | When accessed, it allows the user to register in a SOLID provider
| Friends | This view shows our SOLID friends and also the groups we are in. We can create or delete groups

So, the full building block view would be:
