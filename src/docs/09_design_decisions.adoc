== Design Decisions
****
Brief description of all the decisions we took in order to develop the app.
****

=== Design Architecture
As Solid is a W3C endorsed linked data personal data store (PDS) that puts control into the hands of the user, we'll be using P2p (Peer to peer) design architecture.
Also, we will be following MVC (model view controller) architectual pattern.

=== Programming language
We are using JavaScript family language for building the app as it's the common way to develop some Solid app.

=== Front End 
We will be using *React* for UI as it's server free.
It's mandatory to have some knowdledge at HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript for using React.

=== Control System
We will be using Git as a control system and GitHub as source code manager to keep track of different app versions.

=== Data Storage
There won't be any database in this project as we will be storing user data using private POD's.

=== Testing
_WIP_
